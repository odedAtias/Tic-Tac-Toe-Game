## Implementation Remarks

ðŸ”¸ I have added to the program 4 main functions that will help me perform the task in a simpler way:

1. initializeGame() - A function that initializes the game for the first time.
2. handleCellClick(cellNumber) - A function that handles a player's clicking on the game slots, during its run it checks if the move is legal, updates the board and checks if there is a win.
3. updateChoice(cellNumber) - A function that plots the player's selection on the board.
4. winCheck() - A function that checks whether there is a move that won the game.
5. colorWinningMove(n1, n2, n3) - A function that colors the winning move of the game. 
6. changePlayerTurn() - A function that alternates between the player's turns.
7. handleRestartClick() - A function that restart the game.
